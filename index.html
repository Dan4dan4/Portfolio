           <h3>Previous Experience</h3>
            <p>
              With over 7 years of experience in both dental and jewelry manufacturing fields, I have successfully progressed from hands-on technical
              roles to leadership positions. In the dental field, I started as a Lab Technician where I gained deep understanding of how the dental field 
              works. During my career, I had the opportunity to work with two world-renowned dentists who recognized my talents and contributed to the 
              development of my skills. Over time, I advanced to Project Manager, where I oversaw the full lifecycle of projects, coordinated 
              teams, and ensured the timely delivery of high-quality products. In the jewelry manufacturing industry, I began as a Lab 
              Technician, honing my skills to fabricate jewelry pieces. I later transitioned into the role of Accounting Manager, where I 
              managed financial decisions, budgeting, and reporting, while also contributing to operational efficiency 
              and production workflow.
            </p>
            <h3>Why Software Engineering?</h3>
            <p>I am drawn to software engineering because I see it as an opportunity to create impactful solutions that address real-world 
              problems. With my background in project management and my experience in both dental and jewelry manufacturing, Ive developed 
              a keen understanding of how to identify needs, coordinate teams, and deliver quality results in businesses. After exploring
              coding through Udemy and then attending a bootcamp for Software developing I realized that software development is the perfect
              fit for my skills and ambitions. Whether it's frontend or backend development, I believe I can leverage my problem-solving skills to
              design, code, and refine softwares that makes a tangible difference. Having reached a position as a Project Manager 
              in my previous roles, Ive been looking for a fresh challenge, and software engineering offers the perfect opportunity. 
              Ive always had a drive to learn, and the field of FinTech resonates with my desire to combine innovation with meaningful change.
              My passion for helping others and my ability to adapt to different working environments have prepared me to thrive in this 
              dynamic and evolving field. Im excited about the potential to express my ideas, collaborate with teams, and ultimately 
              contribute to solutions that can transform the way companies operate.
